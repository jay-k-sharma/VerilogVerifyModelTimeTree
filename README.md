# VerilogVerifyModelTimeTree

This repository contains the Verilog verification and LNT modeling of the Mobile TimeTree application.

## Introduction
This project focuses on the verification of the Mobile TimeTree application using Verilog and LNT (LOTOS NT). The goal is to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application through rigorous verification processes.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- **Verification_Modelling_TimeTree Report.pdf**: Detailed report on the verification and modeling process.
- **ProjectSubmission/**: Directory containing the main submission files for the project.
  - **verilog/**: Contains Verilog code for the verification.
  - **lnt/**: Contains LNT models for the application.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jay-k-sharma/VerilogVerifyModelTimeTree.git
cd VerilogVerifyModelTimeTree
```

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Verilog simulation tools (e.g., ModelSim, Icarus Verilog)
- CADP toolbox for LNT modeling

## Running the Verification
Follow these steps to run the verification:

1. Navigate to the `verilog` directory:
   ```sh
   cd ProjectSubmission/verilog
   ```
2. Compile the Verilog code using your preferred Verilog simulator.
3. Navigate to the `lnt` directory:
   ```sh
   cd ../lnt
   ```
4. Use the CADP toolbox to run the LNT models and verify the application.
